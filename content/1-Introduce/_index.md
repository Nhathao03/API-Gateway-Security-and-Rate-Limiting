## Introduction to the Topic
In the context of modern systems increasingly relying on APIs to facilitate communication between services, ensuring the security of APIs has become a critical task. An improperly secured API can become a vulnerability that exposes the entire system to attacks, resulting in data loss, service disruption, or security compliance violations.

**The topic “API Security Gateway with Advanced Protection”** focuses on implementing a highly secure API Gateway architecture on the **AWS** platform, fully integrated with modern protection layers and security standards, including:

## Deployment Objectives
The guide will focus on configuring and deploying **AWS native services** to meet the following requirements:
