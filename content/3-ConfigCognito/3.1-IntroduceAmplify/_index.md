### Overview
AWS Amplify is a toolset that helps developers quickly build and deploy web and mobile applications integrated with AWS services such as API, Authentication, Storage, and Hosting. Amplify simplifies backend management, provides frontend libraries, and offers ready-to-use hosting services for production applications.

### Authentication with Amplify
Authentication with Amplify makes it easy to integrate user authentication features into applications using Amazon Cognito as the backend. It supports sign-up, sign-in, forgot password, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and social sign-in (Google, Facebook, Apple), allowing developers to quickly implement secure user management.

### Storage with Amplify
Storage with Amplify provides a solution for storing files (images, videos, documents) via Amazon S3. Data can be managed with privacy controls (public, protected, private), integrated with user authentication to control access, and supports secure file upload, download, and sharing.
